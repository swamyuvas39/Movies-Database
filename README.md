# Movies-Database
The Movies Database is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that utilizes the OMDB (Open Movie Database) API to fetch and display movie information. It allows users to search for movies by entering a search term and presents the search results on the webpage.

The application consists of the following components:

1.	HTML: The HTML file contains the structure of the web page. It includes a container element, a heading for the page title, a search input field, a search button, and a container to display the movie results.
2.	CSS: The CSS file contains the styles that define the appearance of the web page. It applies styles to elements such as the container, heading, search input, search button, and movie result cards. The styles enhance the visual presentation of the application and make it more user-friendly.
3.	JavaScript: The JavaScript file contains the logic that interacts with the OMDB API and handles user actions. It includes event listeners that respond to user input, such as clicking the search button. The JavaScript code fetches movie data from the OMDB API using the entered search term, processes the response data in JSON format, and dynamically creates HTML elements to display the movie information on the webpage.
4.	OMDB API: The application utilizes the OMDB API, a free movie database API, to fetch movie data. The API allows users to search for movies based on a search term and provides movie information such as title, year, and poster image.
By combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the OMDB API, the Movies Database application provides a user-friendly interface for searching and retrieving movie information, making it a convenient tool for movie enthusiasts and users interested in movie details.
